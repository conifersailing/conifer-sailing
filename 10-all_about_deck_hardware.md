## Rebedding Deck Hardware

I don't have too many pictures of the deck hardware process. Here's what I did:

1. Remove all hardware
2. Overdrilled the bolt holes from the bottom up, stopping short of overdrilling the outer skin. This meant that the holes as viewed from above the deck were unchanged.
3. Sand underside edge of hole and tape
4. Fill with small amount of thickened epoxy
5. Saturate with penetrating epoxy
6. Fill to top with thickened epoxy
7. Re-drill hole
8. Countersink hole with 5/8" countersink
