</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I finished installing the new starboard bulkhead. At about this time, I started poking around the port bulkhead with quite some vigor. I learned from my experience with the starboard bulkhead that rot in plywood can be masked by the outer laminates and you need to be aggressive with a screwdriver in order to confirm its absence. I pulled the port chainplate - check out the video for my thoughts on common chainplate maintenance issues and discussion on the correct methods.</p>

<div class="line">Once I was reassured that the port bulkhead didn't need to be entirely replaced, I returned my attention to the starboard bulkhead and finished up the tabbing to the upper deck. The total lay-up for the starboard bulkhead is as follows:</div>
<div class="line">- 17 oz. 6&quot; bi-axial fiberglass cloth with a sewn-in mat used on the tabs to the hull</div>
<div class="line">- 4 oz. 6&quot; E-glass strips used on the tabs to the deck</div>
<div class="line">This lay-up schedule is similar to what was used originally. I did notice that the original lay-up did not have a lower tab to the hull on the aft side, so I still plan to add that at some point before re-building the galley. But at least for critical structural issues, I am now finished on the starboard bulkhead.</div>

<p>Yay! That wasn't too bad at all! I'll add two more tabs to the starboard bulkhead in the catwalk area, but I consider that as more of the re-coring process, so let's re-core the starboard catwalk next!</p>
