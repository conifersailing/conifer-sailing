<h2>Rebedding Deck Hardware</h2>
<p>I don't have too many pictures of the deck hardware process. Here's what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove all hardware</li>
<li>Overdrilled the bolt holes from the bottom up, stopping short of overdrilling the outer skin. This meant that the holes as viewed from above the deck were unchanged.</li>
<li>Sand underside edge of hole and tape</li>
<li>Fill with small amount of thickened epoxy</li>
<li>Saturate with penetrating epoxy</li>
<li>Fill to top with thickened epoxy</li>
<li>Re-drill hole</li>
<li>Countersink hole with 5/8" countersink</li>
</ol>
